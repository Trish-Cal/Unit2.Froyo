// Prompt the user for froyo flavors upon entering site. 

// Plan - create an alert allowing user to input a string of names separated by commas

// User's input string is split into an array of strings. 

// Use a loop to iterate through the array of flavors.

// Use an object to keep count of how many orders there are of each flavor.

// Correctly count the number of flavors in users input. 

// Organize the frequencies of elements in an array into a function that returns an object.
